* [bip-topl][], from which this package is compiled, can be used as a Dart library. Running bip-topl on the Dart VM is substantially faster than running the pure JavaScript version, so this may
  be appropriate for performance-sensitive applications. The Dart API is also
  (currently) more user-friendly than the JavaScript API. See
  [the Dart bip-topl README][Using Dart Bip-Topl] for details on how to use it.
